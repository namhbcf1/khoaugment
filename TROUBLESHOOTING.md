# 🔧 KhoChuan POS System - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'version')" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend loads but shows "Đang tải..." (Loading...)
- JavaScript error in browser console
- E2E tests fail with timeout errors

**Root Cause:**
- One of the dependencies is trying to access `.version` property on an undefined object
- Likely related to browser API compatibility or environment variable access

**Solutions Applied:**
1. ✅ Fixed `navigator.userAgent` and `navigator.maxTouchPoints` access with safety checks
2. ✅ Fixed `import.meta.env` access with fallbacks
3. ✅ Fixed `window` and `document` access with type checking
4. 🔄 **Still investigating:** Remaining dependency causing the issue

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Ultra-minimal version works perfectly (confirmed working)
- Issue is with one of the imported dependencies

### Issue 2: Large Bundle Size (4.21 MB)

**Current Status:**
- Total bundle: 4.21 MB
- Largest chunk: antd-core-DVlmEpkB.js (686.98 KB)
- Performance score: 30/100

**Optimization Recommendations:**
1. Implement code splitting for large chunks
2. Use dynamic imports for non-critical features
3. Enable tree shaking for unused code
4. Consider lighter alternatives to heavy dependencies

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Critical)
1. **Identify version error source:** Use process of elimination to find the problematic dependency
2. **Fix runtime error:** Ensure app loads completely
3. **Restore full functionality:** Get all pages working

### Medium Priority (High)
1. **Bundle optimization:** Implement code splitting
2. **Performance tuning:** Reduce chunk sizes
3. **Test suite:** Fix E2E tests once runtime error is resolved

### Low Priority (Polish)
1. **PWA optimization:** Enhance offline capabilities
2. **SEO improvements:** Meta tags and structured data
3. **Accessibility:** ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
